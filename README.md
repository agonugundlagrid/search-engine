This is the a project on creating a simple **Search Engine Java** 

## Description
Now let's Improve your search engine to make it support complex queries containing word sequences and use several strategies that determine how to match data.

**##Objectives**
In this stage, your program should be able to use such searching strategies as ALL, ANY, and NONE.

**#Take, for example, these six sample lines:**

Dwight Joseph djo@gmail.com
Rene Webb webb@gmail.com
Katie Jacobs
Erick Harrington harrington@gmail.com
Myrtle Medina
Erick Burgess

**##If the strategy is ALL, the program should print lines containing all the words from the query.**
**#Query:**
Harrington Erick

#Result:
Erick Harrington harrington@gmail.com

**##If the strategy is ANY, the program should print the lines containing at least one word from the query.
#Query:**

Erick Dwight webb@gmail.com

**#Result:**

Erick Harrington harrington@gmail.com
Erick Burgess
Dwight Joseph djo@gmail.com
Rene Webb webb@gmail.com

**##If the strategy is NONE, the program should print lines that do not contain words from the query at all:
#Query:**

djo@gmail.com ERICK

**#Result:**

Katie Jacobs
Myrtle Medina
Rene Webb webb@gmail.com

**#All listed operations are implemented in the inverted index. The results should not contain duplicates.**

**#Do not forget to use methods to decompose your program.**

**#Example**
The lines that start with > represent the user input. Note that these symbols are not part of the input.

=== Menu ===
1. Find a person
2. Print all persons
0. Exit
> 1

Select a matching strategy: ALL, ANY, NONE
> ANY
> 
Enter a name or email to search all suitable people.
